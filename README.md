# Dead-Mans-Sea
A 2D pirate themed bullet hell game


Description:

Bullet hell meets the open water as players must navigate their ship through obstacles and hoards of cannon fire to sink their enemies, but with each level comes an increasingly stronger armada ready to serve up a one-way ticket to Davy Jones. One can only dream of the treasure that is guarded by the myths and legends of the sea but no one knows what could truly be lurking in the depths of Dead Man's Sea.


This game was created as a group project for CPI 111 at ASU.
The original repo is privated due to it being a university project.
This repo serves as a public repo for the game and for my personal additions.
